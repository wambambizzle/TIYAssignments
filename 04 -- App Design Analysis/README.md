## App Design Analysis - Navigation Styles

* Choose 12 apps from the App Store or from your personal list of installed apps. Find apps that fall into one of the following categories:
	* games
	* photography
	* social media
	* to-do apps
	* calendar apps
	* apps that deal with sound or music (Spotify for example).

* Write up a basic hierarchy of navigation for each app. See the example below. Notice both the presentation of each screen of information as well as the way in which each screen transitions between one another. After naming the feature or screen, add what kind of view is used.

* After completing the analysis of the 12 apps, try to find 3 more apps that don't fall into any of the above categories. Run the same analysis and see how they compare to these popular app categories.
